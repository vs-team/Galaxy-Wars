In this project folder every [file].cs is cleared. 
Only basic functions that require to run are coded. 
All other stuff has to be added, like spawnpoints and rotations. 

Here is a task list for rebuilding the projects code


Martijn
Zombies and landscape: (like in galaxy wars with the ships)
Zombies are created in the landscape
One frame after the zombies are created in the landscape, they have to be moved to the world. 
The zombies in the landscapes can now be destroyed



Hidde
Pistol and flashlight are both controlled by the razor. The razor has a seperate entity called ControllerRazor. 
In ControllerRazor we need:
	- Which hand belongs to which controller
	- the value of the trigger
	- (gameObject position and rotation) or the raycast
	- Docked / Enabled

All the other information can be ignored  



Wouter
The truck movement with an engine:
The engine gets the values from the steering wheel and pedals.
	The steering wheel changes the rotation (v3 / quat)
	The left pedal is for BrakeAndReverse (float between 0.0f and 1.0f)
	The right pedal is for Accel (float between 0.0f and 1.0f)
	The active is to start the motor and stop when crashed(button on steering wheel)


Martijn
The truck moves based on the values of the engine.
