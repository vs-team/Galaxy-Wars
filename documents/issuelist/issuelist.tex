\section{Synchronizing}
Can Unity synchronize the frame rate on all four walls with the current setup of four slaves and one master computer? Is this supported? If not, would it be possible to write this and how much work would this be?

\section{Sensor Support}
Is it possible to use the controllers that are currently used in the augmented reality lab in Unity? If not, can this be build and how much work would this be?

\section{Player Tracking}
Would it be possible to use the delivered equipment for the augmented reality lab in Unity or is implementation required?


\section{Multiplayer Support Casanova}
Is there the availability to synchronize the game logic over the network simply using casanova or does the game logic need its own multiplayer implementation?
