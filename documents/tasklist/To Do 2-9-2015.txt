tasklist 2-9-2015

Working pairs for the oncoming weeks:

Justin & Wouter
Hidde & Martijn

Wouter: 

Find out about synchronizing the game logic between multiple computers. Start of easy by sending
one piece of data from one instance of Unity to another.

Martijn:

Start building the scenes for the game Pieter has chosen. Think in general lines such as the background and
the beams of the vehicle to cover the edges of the screen. The filling of these parts should have nothing to do
with the game logic.

Hidde: 

Start searching for simple art for the background and build this into the scene Martijn will be building.

Justin: 
Set up the Casanova infrastructure on github so that game logic can be written. Start by implementing
the simple game logic for the game that does not require synchronization.
